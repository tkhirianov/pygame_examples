    submenu.py
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    More advanced approach compared to `simplemenu.py` as this module provides
    an approach to implement a generic, but easy to use menu system that
    supports submenus!

    Still it is realized only with basic Python data types.

    Each menu consists of this dictionary structure:

        {
            "root": (
                ("text to be shown", <function object>),
                ("another item text", <another function object>),
                (..., ...),

                or

                ("text", "submenu1"),
                (<string>, <string of key to submenu>)
            ),
            "submenu1": (
                (<string>, <function object>),
                ...
            ),
            ...
        }

    Every menu must habe a 'root' key. That is the entrypoint for the
    `handle_menu` function. To make an entry that leads to a submenu, just
    put the key of that submenu as second parameter of one menu item. This
    way you can also 'go back' from a submenu to the 'root'-menu.

    To be more generic, each 'callable' can be used as second argument.

    The user can choose via an computed index, which action should be
    triggered by the core function `handle_menu`.

    Hint: Both functions `print_menu` ans `get_user_input` are exactly the
    same as in the `simplemenu`-module. We could have easily imported them,
    but I wanted to make this work out of the box.

    This is esspecially written for beginners, so there is no magic like
    `functools.partial` or some closures to create demo functions.
