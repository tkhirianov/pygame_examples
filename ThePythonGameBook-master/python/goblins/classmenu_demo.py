    classymenu.py
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    The most advanced module to create and handle menus with basic Python
    kwnoledges.
    
    This time we use a class to represent and handle our menu tasks.
    
    It might be understandable even for newbies, but you should have been
    familiar to classes in Python.
    
    Of course the core ideas do not differ from the other, structure and
    function based approaches within this folder. As you can see a class is
    often the more comfortable way to handle deeply nested data structures.
    
    Our latest approach in `metamenu.py` handles tuples in a dictionary 
    in a dictionary... that ist not very comfortable to deal with. You can
    get confused by indexes and perhaps keys. It feels less clumsy to deal
    with attributes of a class.

    Class that represents and handles a complete menu system all in once.
    
    Each menu class can...
    
        ... print out the (current) menu
        ... handle the user input
        ... run in an event-loop, that handles the complete menu based
            workflow.
    
    It provides the `finish`-method, which adds automatically all needed
    'Exit'-entries to each (sub)menu, so building up a menu is not so much
    typing.
    
    To avoid recursion, we use the `context`-attribute of the Menu-class. The
    current menu-object is always bound to this attribute. As we can combine
    arbitrary menu objects (via the `append_submenu`-method) we must keep
    the current working menu accessible to operate only in one object, the
    'root'-object.
