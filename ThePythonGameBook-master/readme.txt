readme for ThePythonGameBook on Github.com

the idea of this project is to host and sync source code and files for

ThePythonGameBook.com ( http://ThePythonGameBook.com ) 

and make use of githubs download button to have an .zip or .tar.gz file of all sourcecode examples including the necessary binary files and folders.

For questions, please write an email to horstjens@gmail.com
